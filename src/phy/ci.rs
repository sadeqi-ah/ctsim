//! CI (Constructive Interference) engine.
//!
//! Rounds are time-bound up to `round_slots`, but **end early** once the flood
//! wave finishes (no node remains in Flood). That removes long all-Sleep padding
//! after the wave has already completed.
//!
//! Slot rule: state fixed at slot start → action from that state → transitions for next slot.
//!
//! Pipelines use [`flood_identical_round`]: one identical payload for the whole round
//! (no mid-round Protocol merge). Middleware runs only after the flood returns.
